About: <a id="about"></a>

Lumi Buds is an original concept that combines functionality and visual appeal.
The project highlights my ability to merge 3D modeling, front-end development, and interactive media design into one cohesive product experience.
It demonstrates how a product can come to life digitally, through texture, light, animation, and interactivity; while maintaining responsive, mobile-first usability across devices.
